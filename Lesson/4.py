#Tuple
"""
Tuples
Tuples are fixed size in nature whereas lists are dynamic.
In other words, a tuple is immutable whereas a list is mutable.
You can't add elements to a tuple. Tuples have no append or extend method.
You can't remove elements from a tuple. Tuples have no remove or pop method.
You can find elements in a tuple, since this doesnâ€™t change the tuple.
You can also use the in operator to check if an element exists in the tuple.

MyList = [1,2,3,4,5]
MyTuple = (1,2,3,4,5)
